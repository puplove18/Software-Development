/*
Write a function that reverses a given int array. For example, if you get {2, 5, 3, 1}, your function
should change the array to {1, 3, 5, 2}. Test your function by printing its result on a few arrays.
Hint: Use the function of the previous exercise.
Adapt the function to work with strings. What needs to change?
Bonus: Read a text from the user (you can assume that less than 1024 characters are entered) and check
whether the given text is a palindrome, i.e. whether it is the same if read from the front and the back,
such as “racecar”.
