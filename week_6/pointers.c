/*
Define a struct that can store a 2D-point, i.e. an x- and y-coordinate. Write a function that takes a point
and prints it to the console.
Also write a function that reads coordinates from the user and stores them in a point. (Remember to use
a constructor or initializer.)
Bonus: Create a set of basic point functions to work with points. For example: Adding two points
together, compute the (euclidean) distance of two points, multiply with a given scalar, â€¦
